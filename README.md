# Nexpose add-on for Dradis

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-nexpose.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-nexpose) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-nexpose.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-nexpose.png)

The Nexpose add-on enables users to upload Nexpose XML files to create a structure of nodes/notes that contain the same information about the hosts/ports/services as the original file.

This plugin supports both NeXpose-Simple and NeXpose-Full formats.

The add-on requires Dradis 3.0 or higher.
